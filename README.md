How to Play

The game is played entirely through the command line interface. When you start the game, you will be presented with a prompt where you can enter commands to interact with the game. (We suggest you to run above game files in any modern IDE's eg Visual Studios, IntelliJ etc.)

The following commands are available:

- `<direction>`: Moves the player in the specified direction (N - north, S- south, E - east, or W - west).
- `look`: Displays a description of the current room.
- `inventory`: Displays the player's current inventory.
- `take <item>`: Adds the specified item to the player's inventory.
- `use <item>`: Uses the specified item in the current room.
- `help`: Displays a list of available commands.
